      For one will scarcely die for a righteous person -

      Originally, we were made in God's image - 
      made to be intimately in relationship with God, 
      to glorify Him  by reflecting His character. 
      However, when temptation came, 
      humanity turned away from God and fell into  sin. 
      Since then, All of us are born with sinful nature, 
      as natural enemies of God.

      It doesn't take much searching to recognize the wrongdoing in our lives.  We lie, we envy, we hurt others, at times we are filled with anger, bitterness, hatred... and the list goes on.  We are fallen, immeasurably far from God's standard and who we were meant to be.

      The problem of sin isn't merely the damage it afflicts upon others, 
      but that we rebelled against God who 
      gave us everything and created us for his glory. 
      We all chose our own way over His way, 
      and to love sin rather than our creator.

      God being perfectly just and righteous cannot let sin go unpunished. 
      Yet at the same time, 
      God loves us and is unwilling for all to perish in eternal judgement.  
      So in order to satisfy His just wrath, 
      fulfill justice and display his righteousness, 
      He sent his only son  Jesus Christ to pay the price for our sin, 
      that we may be reconciled to Him and receive forgiveness and salvation.
      Jesus lived the perfect life we could never live 
      (fulfilling the prophecies in scripture), 
      and died the death we all deserve, 
      so he could clear us of the debt we were unable to repay.

      Three days after Jesus died, He rose again, 
      demonstrating his total victory over sin and death and  
      that the work on the cross was complete. 
      God has promised through the Bible that whoever repents  of their sin,
      turns to Him and places their faith in Jesus Christ, 
      they shall be saved and receive a new  relationship with God,
      with the Holy Spirit dwelling in them to live as a new creation. 
      Jesus invites all who are willing to trade their burden of sin to
      come to Him: “Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, 
      and I will give you rest.  Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, 
      for I am gentle and lowly in heart,
      and you will find rest  for your souls. 
      For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.”

      God has offered salvation as a free gift to any who would accept it, 
      it cannot be earned by good works or any other human effort. 
      If you are not a believer, we plead with you to consider the gospel.  
      Faith is believing in the unseen, not the unreasonable.
