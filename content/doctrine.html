    The sole basis of our beliefs is the Bible, 
    God’s inerrant complete Word - the 66 books  of the Old and New Testaments. 
    It is the infallible, authoritative, 
    and normative rule of all  Christian life, practice, and doctrine.
    The core Biblical teachings that we explicitly affirm are  as follows: 
  </li>
  <li>
    The Father: We believe that God the Father is the creator of heaven and earth.
    By His Word and for His glory, 
    He freely and supernaturally created the world out of nothing.  
    Through the same Word, He daily sustains all creation.  
    He rules over all and His plans and purposes cannot be thwarted. 
  </li>
  <li>
    We believe in the total deity of the Lord Jesus Christ 
    who is the  manifestation of God in the flesh. 
    He was conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin  Mary. 
    He is fully God and fully man. Through Him, 
    all things came into being and were created.  
    He was before all creation, and in Him, 
    all things hold together by the word of His power.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Holy Spirit: We believe in the Holy Spirit, 
    the Lord and Giver of life.  
    He is the Third Person of the trinity and unites believers to Jesus Christ in faith,  
    brings about the new birth and dwells within the regenerate.  
    He has come to glorify the Son who, in turn, came to glorify the Father, 
    leading the Church  into orthodoxy and orthopraxy.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Condition of Man: We believe that though God had made man – 
    male and female –  in His own image as the crown of creation. 
    Humanity was tempted by Satan and rebelled  against God 
    and thus subject to rightful punishment in hell. 
    Fallen, sinful people,  whatever their character or attainments, 
    are lost and without hope apart from salvation in Christ alone. 
  </li>
  <li>
    Salvation: We believe that our salvation is wholly 
    a work of God’s free grace and is not  the result, 
    in whole or in part, of human works, goodness, or religious ceremony.  
    The Lord Jesus Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures 
    and is the substitutionary  and propitiatory sacrifice to God 
    for our sins, permanently covering the sins of those who believe in Him.
    There is no other name by which man can be saved. 
  </li>
  <li>
    Resurrection: We believe that Jesus resurrected three days after His death 
    on the cross in our place.  Redeeming us from sin, 
    He rose bodily from the grave on the third day, 
    victorious over death and the powers of darkness and performed 
    many convincing proofs of His resurrection.  
    He ascended into heaven and intercedes for His people at 
    the right hand of God. 
  </li>
  <li>
    The Consummation: We believe that Jesus Christ will return to the earth again 
    – personally, visibly,  and bodily – 
    to consummate history and the entire plan of God.  
    The lost will be raised to judgement and experience eternal wrath in hell. 
    The saved will be raised to eternal joy 
    in the new heaven and new earth in the presence of God.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Great Commission: We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ commanded 
    all believers to proclaim  the gospel and disciple men and women 
    throughout the world.  The fulfillment of the Great Commission requires 
    that all worldly and personal ambition be  subordinated to a total 
    commitment to God alone.
